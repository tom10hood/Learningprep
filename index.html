            <p>As you can see, a good data visualization  can make all the difference when conveying information. But <em> what specifically separates effective data visualizations from ineffective ones?</em></p>
    
      <p> <b>What Makes for a Good Data Visualizations </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reliable information</li> 
                <li>Visually encoded so relevant patterns become noticeable</li> 
                <li>Organized in a way that enables at least some exploration, when itâ€™s appropriate</li>
                <li> Presented in an attractive manner, but always remembering that honesty, clarity, and depth come first</li>
                <li>Relevant: visualization should fit the context</li>
            </ul>
    
     <p>The Life Satisfaction  visualization is was formed with data collected from a reliable well known institution The World Happiness report The 100 Most Active Tweeters visualization does not even have a citation. It is not hard to see that the Quality of life graph makes the relevant information more noticeable using a color scheme while the bad visualization appearance makes it difficult to understand what information to take away. The Life Satisfaction Visualizations is easy to explore because it has clear indicators of where you should examine due to well selected colors. The Most Active Tweeters visualization lacks organization. I think the Life Satisfaction visualizationis contain a honesty clarity and depth in an effective manner while the Most Active Tweeters visualization does not. Finally, the Active Tweeters model was in context, it  was found in a list of the worst data visualizations  of 2019. The Life Satisfaction  visualization was in context, in the World Happiness Report.
